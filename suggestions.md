`try deploying this on heorku for the OP - full credits to them`

suggestions:
1. show only the ones available in my region
2. UI to be non-jumpy - static place for icons (I should be able to keep tapping on X or like without the card jumping due to image/text)
3. filters - browse in a specific category (genre, type(movie/series), imdb rating)
4. 


tasks:
 - replace the default image with something generic (Yikes, no Image available!)
 - resize the image to be smaller
 - the heart & cross icons to be inside the container
 - set the attributes in better UI - side by side
 - fa colours variation
